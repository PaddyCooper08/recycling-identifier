# recycling-identifier
Start of a project which will allow the user to scan the triangle on the bottom of anything plastic and receive info on its recyclability. Currently just a dataset and model but I'm hoping to flesh it out soon.

# Getting started
clone the repo, install the dependencies then run the global script before running the test_train file. You'll get a few things printed and a graph displayed as well.
